In recent years, GPUs have become crucial tools in high performance computing. To understand the evolution of these devices, we conducted a study analyzing hardware trends in GPUs. This information provides valuable insights into GPU programming and emerging trends in this field. We mainly focus on three features: the floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) of floating-point units (FPUs), device memory access, and machine balance.

<!-- Parallel computing techniques have been introduced into digital image correlation (DIC) in recent years and leads to a surge in computation speed. The graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallel computing demonstrated a surprising effect on accelerating the iterative subpixel DIC, compared with CPU-based parallel computing. In this paper, the performances of the two kinds of parallel computing techniques are compared for the previously proposed path-independent DIC method, in which the initial guess for the inverse compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN) algorithm at each point of interest (POI) is estimated through the fast Fourier transform-based cross-correlation (FFT-CC) algorithm. Based on the performance evaluation, a heterogeneous parallel computing (HPC) model is proposed with hybrid mode of parallelisms in order to combine the computing power of GPU and multicore CPU. A scheme of trial computation test is developed to optimize the configuration of the HPC model on a specific computer. The proposed HPC model shows excellent performance on a middle-end desktop computer for real-time subpixel DIC with high resolution of more than 10000 POIs per frame. -->
