Stencil computation is a crucial component in a variety of scientific applications HPC applications such as earthquake simulation, seismic imaging, computational fluid dynamics, climate modeling, etc. As the memory bandwidth on the HPC systems struggles to keep up with the ever-increasing flops rates, the low arithmetic intensity of stencil computations reveals not only many computational challenges but also unique opportunities to benefit from existing modern and future architectures, the MS will include topics around:
