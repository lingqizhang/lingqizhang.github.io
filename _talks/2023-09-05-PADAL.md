The imbalance between compute and memory bandwidth has been a long-standing issue. Despite efforts to address it, the gap between the two has continued to widen. This has led to the categorization of many applications as memory-bound kernels.

We seek to exploit the latest GPU features to optimize memory-bound kernels. Specifically, we introduce strategies to extend the lifetime of kernels across time steps to take advantage of the large volume of on-chip resources. Additionally, we propose to seize the minimal level of parallelism to maximize the available on-chip resources. 

This talk will cover our proposals built on top of such strategies that have shown outstanding performance in the latest GPU architectures (i.e., Tesla V100 and A100 GPUs).
