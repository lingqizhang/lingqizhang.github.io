Hello World
======

This is the hello world of this blog. I will occasionally post content on this personal website.

Self Introduction
======

This is Lingqi Zhang. I am a Post Doc researcher at RIKEN-RCCS. 
My research topics mainly relate to parallel programming, especially with regards to GPUs. Some of the research has been published in top-tier conferences ([ICSs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3577193.3593716), [IPDPS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9139854), [SC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9355256)). I have also collaborated on computer architecture-related research ([TACO](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3629520), [IPDPS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9460517)). 

As I joined RIKEN, my main research focus has shifted to applying AI in scientific research.

Motivation
======
The intention of this blog is to post content related to topics I encounter during my research. While publishing papers remains my priority, not every topic I explore is suitable for academic publications. However, some of these themes hold value and are worth sharing nonetheless.
