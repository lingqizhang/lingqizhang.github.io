General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) are used in most of the top systems in HPC. The total capacity of scratchpad memory has increased by more than 40 times in the last decade. However, existing optimizations for stencil computations using temporal blocking have not aggressively exploited the large capacity of scratchpad memory. This work uses the 2D Jacobian 5-point iterative stencil as a case study to investigate the use of large scratchpad memory. Unlike existing research that tiles the domain in a thread block fashion, we tile the domain so that each tile is large enough to utilize all available scratchpad memory on the GPU. Consequently, we process several time steps inside a single tile before offloading the result back to global memory. Our evaluation shows that our performance is comparable to state-of-the-art implementations, yet our implementation is much simpler and does not require auto-generation of code.
