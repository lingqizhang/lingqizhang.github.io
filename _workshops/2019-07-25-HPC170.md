: GPUs are playing an increasingly important role in general-purpose computing. Various scientific fields utilize the power of GPUs. Many complex algorithms require different levels of synchronizations, through the use of
barriers. Many researchers struggle to implement communication methods for GPUs, and thus implementations tend to under-perform for specific algorithms that require device-wide barriers. This work approaches this problem by using
micro-benchmarks to study Nvidia’s new synchronization methods, as well as the performance they yield.
