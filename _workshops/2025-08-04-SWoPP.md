Tensor cores are specialized processing units within GPUs that have demonstrated significant efficiency gains in compute-bound applications by accelerating dense matrix operations. This work examines whether tensor cores can effectively accelerate workloads beyond general matrix multiplication (GEMM) operations. Through analytical study, we investigate the theoretical and practical limits of using tensor cores for non-GEMM workloads, including memory-bound kernels. Our analysis reveals that tensor cores provide limited benefits for such workloads, challenging recent claims about their broader applicability.
